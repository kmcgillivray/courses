# Courses

I like to look for patterns and connections between the things I'm reading, watching, listening to, and thinking about and give the themes that I notice crazy fake "course" names like the ones below. Learning can sometimes feel like an ever-expanding web of connected ideas and thoughts, so giving them a name helps me keep the connections somewhat organized. It also helps me look for more things on similar topics so that I can keep exploring in an interesting direction once I've found one.

The process tends to go like this: I read, watch lectures, go to museums, listen to music, etc., but as I do so I try to look for common themes or threads that connect the different things I'm exploring. Once something becomes clear, I'll make a note of it, and give it a "course" name. I also sometimes have a project or two to go with a course.

The reading lists are grouped into related categories. There is also often overlap between different courses as they look at the same works from different perspectives.

If you have your own reading lists or have any questions or comments, let me know on twitter [@kev_mcg](http://twitter.com/kev_mcg) or in the [issues](http://github.com/kmcgillivray/courses/issues) for this repository.

## Web Development and Computer Science

### Web Development: History and Philosophy

The web is a field defined by the ideas and values of those who create it. This course explores the history of thought that has shaped the web and the philosophical debates visible in the design of the network, and connects those ideas to both the overall architects of the web and the day-to-day practitioners who define web culture through their words and code.

### Artificial Intelligence, Technology, and Innovation

With rumors of the technological singularity floating around, this course explores two questions: Are we the originators of technology, or is technology its own entity evolving through us? And, if the future belongs to those who know how to best collaborate with machines, how can we improve our symbiosis with technology to allow it to augment our own abilities?

Logic and intuition are the two human superpowers that combine to create a third superpower: creativity. This course will explore how these two modes of thinking play out practically in the creative process and historically in the progress of human ingenuity. It will also argue that combining these two skills is an evergreen theme in humanity's search for meaning, and an essential step in unlocking the full potential of human creativity.

## Design

### Perspectives on Industrial Design: The World of Objects

It's easy to take for granted the objects in our lives. What makes a high quality object and a low quality object? How does our relationship with objects influence our lives? What cultural differences exist in how people relate to objects? What ideas guide the people who design these objects? What is the relationship between the designer, the designed object, and the people who interact with it? This course focuses especially on Japanese design.
