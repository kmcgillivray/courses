# Courses

I like to look for patterns and connections between the things I'm reading, watching, listening to, and thinking about and give the themes that I notice crazy fake "course" names like the ones below. Learning can sometimes feel like an ever-expanding web of connected ideas and thoughts, so giving them a name helps me keep the connections somewhat organized. It also helps me look for more things on similar topics so that I can keep exploring in an interesting direction once I've found one.

The process tends to go like this: I read, watch lectures, go to museums, etc., but as I do so I try to look for common themes or threads that connect the different things I'm exploring. Once something becomes clear, I'll make a note of it, and give it a "course" name. I also sometimes have a final project to go with a course.

The reading lists are in no particular order. There is also often overlap between different courses as they look at the same works from different perspectives.

If you have your own reading lists or have any questions or comments, let me know on twitter [@kev_mcg](http://twitter.com/kev_mcg) or in the [issues](http://github.com/kmcgillivray/courses/issues) for this repository.

### Perspectives on Industrial Design: The World of Objects

It's easy to take for granted the objects in our lives. What makes a high quality object and a low quality object? How does our relationship with objects influence our lives? What cultural differences exist in how people relate to objects? What ideas guide the people who design these objects? What is the relationship between the designer, the designed object, and the people who interact with it? This course focuses especially on Japanese design.
